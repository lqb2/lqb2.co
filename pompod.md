community infrastructure to get shit done! [the pomodoro technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFW3Ld7JO0w) + collective accountability.


use the text thread to let people know when you'll be on. join the meeting room. 


the first 5 mins of each half hour is for checking in and listing out what you'll be working on. the next 25 mins is for focused workflow. repeat as long as feels good.
