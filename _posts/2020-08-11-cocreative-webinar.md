“History is not the past, it is the present. We carry our history with us. We are our history.” — James Baldwin

 

“...personal problems are political problems. There are no personal solutions at this time.” — Carol Hanish

 

“Those who do not have power over the story that dominates their lives, the power to retell it, rethink it, deconstruct it, joke about it, and change it as times change, truly are powerless, because they cannot think new thoughts.” — Salman Rushdie

 

In this highly participatory talk, we will explore the power of personal storytelling by re-membering ourselves through the lens of the personal, the political, and the planetary. We will navigate the perpetual tension between the individual and the systemic to honor our differences as we create new senses of belonging and liberatory power.
