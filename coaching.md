> "A great coach tells you what you need to hear not what you want to hear." â€” Sagi Kalev

I offer both life coaching and professional coaching services. My life coaching practice almost always begins with a 3-session [intro package](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TkkuWMfPaB0wcUFwisYbj-znRdkJl2mBFIUpMMeefSU/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}. Sessions can be added ad-hoc or in sets of three. Without a package, I typically book calls 6 weeks in advance. 

I generally only offer professional coaching through an employer, but if you're interested, reach out and let's see what's possible.
